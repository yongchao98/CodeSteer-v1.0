## Framework

<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">
Figure: CodeSteer on guiding LLM code/text generation to integrate symbolic computing. At each interaction with TaskLLM, it reviews current and previous answers, then provides guidance for the next round.

## Inspirations

<p align="center" style="font-size: 16px;">
Figure: The cases that GPT-4o makes simple mistakes by direct textual reasoning but can reliably solve the problem with prompted to use code.
</p>


## Performance
We compare GPT-4o + CodeSteer with OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 on SymBench, with 28 seen tasks and 9 unseen tasks. GPT-4o + CodeSteer surpasses o1 (82.7), R1 (76.8), and o1-preview (74.8), highlighting the importance of integrating symbolic computing into LLMs.

The cost of tokens and runtimes for each method are as follows. GPT-4o + CodeSteer costs less tokens and runtimes than o1 and R1.

## Environment Setup
The fine-tuning and inference of CodeSteerLLM are based on [Llama-factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) with some modules modified by us.
```
git clone https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0.git
cd CodeSteer-v1.0

conda create -n CodeSteer python=3.10
conda activate CodeSteer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## LLM API Key Setup
If you want to use several API-based LLMs as TaskLLM or CodeSteerLLM, then you need to set up API key.

1. First, create a .env file in your project root:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='your_key_here'
CLAUDE_API_KEY='your_key_here'
MIXTRAL_API_KEY='your_key_here'
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_key_here'
```
2. Add this .env file to your .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing it:
```
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

## Train and Test Models

### Create test samples
The synthesized test samples for 37 tasks of SymBench are in [dataset_gather](https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0/tree/main/dataset_gather) dictionary. You can also synthezise the samples by yourself with tunable complexities with scripts in [create_dataset](https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0/tree/main/create_dataset).

### Run inference without GPU, test close LLM as CodeSteerLLM
We can directly use unfinetuned model like GPT-4o as CodeSteerLLM, in this case directly run
```
python benchmark_test_baseline.py
```

### Run inference with GPU, test finetuned CodeSteerLLM
We can infer Llama-3.1-8B with own GPUs (default setting is in infer_CodeSteer.sh using 4*H100 of Harvard Cluster, please modify freely with your own cluster settings). You can also download the [Model Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qb_rec6f8rMYtFKm0eQpad0L0uHCwgpL?usp=share_link) in your local and change the path in llama3_8B_CodeSteer.yaml.

```bash
bash infer_CodeSteer.sh
# default config file is ./llama3_8B_CodeSteer.yaml using the model uploaded on Huggingface.
```

### Finetuning CodeSteerLLM with synthesized data
Both our synthesized datasets of SFT and DPO finetuning are in [Finetune Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Byn-99gFd5ckRkPMJ8-zagzW7XDfO8ie?usp=share_link).
We use Llama-factory and DeepSpeed for fintuning processes. First install Llama-factory with:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]"
```

The run the code with (default setting is in train_llama3-8B-CodeSteer.sh using 4*H100 of Harvard Cluster, please modify freely with your own cluster settings):
```
bash train_llama3-8B-CodeSteer.sh
```
