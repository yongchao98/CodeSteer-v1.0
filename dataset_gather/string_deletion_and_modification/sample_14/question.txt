Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.
2. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.
3. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
4. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
5. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
6. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.

For the string "aaaaacabacbcbc", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
