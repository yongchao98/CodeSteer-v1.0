Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
2. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
3. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
4. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
5. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.
6. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.

For the string "cabbbbbbbbbcaaaacb", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
