Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.
2. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
3. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.
4. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.
5. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.
6. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.

For the string "bacccaccbca", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
