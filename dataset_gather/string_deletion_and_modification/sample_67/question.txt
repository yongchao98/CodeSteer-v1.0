Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
2. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
4. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
5. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
6. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
