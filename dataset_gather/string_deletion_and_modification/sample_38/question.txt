Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.
2. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.
3. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.
4. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
5. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.
6. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.

For the string "baccaccaabcbabcacc", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
