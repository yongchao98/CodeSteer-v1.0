Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.
2. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
3. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.
4. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
5. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
6. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.

For the string "bcbbabccbcacbabacabb", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
