Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
2. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
3. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.
4. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
5. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
6. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.

For the string "ccacbaabacbcacbccc", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
