Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
2. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
3. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.
4. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
5. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
6. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.

For the string "bccccbcccababcccacb", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
