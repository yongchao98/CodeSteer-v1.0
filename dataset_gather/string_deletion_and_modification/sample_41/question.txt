Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.
2. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
4. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.
5. If the string contains an even number of 'b's (and at least one 'b'), append 'ab' at the end.
6. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.

For the string "cabacbbababcbacb", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
