1. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.
2. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
3. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
4. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
5. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.
6. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.
