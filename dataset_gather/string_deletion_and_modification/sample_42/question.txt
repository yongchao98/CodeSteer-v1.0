Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string contains an even number of 'b's (and at least one 'b'), append 'ab' at the end.
2. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.
3. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.
4. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
5. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
6. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.

For the string "aabbbcbcaaaabaaab", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
