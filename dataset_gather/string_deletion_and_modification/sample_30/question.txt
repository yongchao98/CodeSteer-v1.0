Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
2. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.
3. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
4. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.
5. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.
6. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
