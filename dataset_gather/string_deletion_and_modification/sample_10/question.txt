Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.
2. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
3. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.
4. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.
5. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.
6. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
