Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
2. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
3. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
4. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.
5. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
6. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.
