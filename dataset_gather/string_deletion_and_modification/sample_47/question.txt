Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
2. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
3. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.
4. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
5. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
6. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.

For the string "cacbcbbbabbabacc", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:
