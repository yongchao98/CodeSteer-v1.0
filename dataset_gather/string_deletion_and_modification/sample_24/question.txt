Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.
2. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
3. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.
4. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.
5. If the string starts with 'bb', remove the second character.
6. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.

For the string "acbacbcaacabcababbc", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
