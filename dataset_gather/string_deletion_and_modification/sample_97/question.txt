Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.
2. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.
3. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
4. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
5. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.
6. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.

For the string "aacbbacacabbba", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
