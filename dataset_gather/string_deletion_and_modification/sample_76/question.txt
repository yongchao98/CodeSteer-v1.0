Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
2. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.
3. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
4. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.
5. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.
6. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.

For the string "bbaaacccaaccabbca", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
