Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
2. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
3. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.
4. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.
5. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.
6. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.

For the string "cbababccac", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
