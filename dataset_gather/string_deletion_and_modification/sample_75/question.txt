Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
2. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.
4. If the string contains 'bca', delete the first occurrence entirely.
5. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.
6. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.

For the string "acaccacbcbcbabbbacb", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
