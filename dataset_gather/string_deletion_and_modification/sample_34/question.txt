Cycle through the following operations one at a time until no further operations can be performed:

1. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.
2. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.
3. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').
4. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.
5. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.
6. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.

For the string "aacccabbbbcaacaacbcc", what is the final string after performing all operations?

Provide your answer as a string in the following format:

<<< "some_final_string" >>>
