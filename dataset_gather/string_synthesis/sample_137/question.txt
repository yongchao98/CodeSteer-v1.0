There are nine different blocks [A], [B], [C], {A}, {B}, {C}, (A), (B), (C) that satisfy:
1. One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.
2. One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.
3. One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.
4. Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.
5. One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).
6. Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).

Cycle through Methods 1..6 repeatedly until no more changes can be made.

Question: If we now have 2 [A], 1 [B], and 4 [C], what will the synthesized block be?
