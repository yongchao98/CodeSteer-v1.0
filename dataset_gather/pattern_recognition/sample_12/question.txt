Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

B E S O W T U P Q J F F
W J D R F N H H J N P B
S D O N N N N O R A T X
H S R N N N N Y E Y K G
C L L N N N N O Y Y P H
H W D N N N N I K O D D
P P V R R H Q Q F A N E
J B M F C P X A L N B P
Z Y O A Q T D J D K M O

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
