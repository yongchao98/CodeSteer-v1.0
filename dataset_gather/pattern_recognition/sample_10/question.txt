Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

Z J B B O W C O S V L K A M K
D J R J Q T G J U E N M R A U
Y Y H P M H J A A N Y W P A M
S Z Z D Y W J H J S M X B V R
H K W Q V U A L B A I D E V P
A Y M C N X X X U S R P X O O
Z Y R T X X X X M H F T K H F
P I Z Z Q X X X R X T O R A B
M E V R X B U K W L Z A H M B
P S I X F E Z P V W M C V B B
E K U A P B M T P J T A S L A
C R W P Q R Y X S C O E A J G
T S H U U I G J L U B Q J I B

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
