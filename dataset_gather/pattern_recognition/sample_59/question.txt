Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

O I Y C Z J Y V O F R X T A
V Y V I F M H R Z Q Z X B M
I B R R O Z A L E Z D B G X
M T V B K D I T K K K K K Y
F X K W D M I W K K K K K C
Q K O H V Q P T K K K K K A
Q I B V L H K A K K K K K M
C A H C M P L Z K K K K K D
W I I U N N D S V R C E L B
P B S U N Z M Y V U Y L Q A
D S F J O D P W K Q P J V M
V U M F N A S C I X I T B I

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
