Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

L H P T T K A S
B W W W D I J W
U W W W A A E A
O W W W T T Y S
D M Z V D Z Y V
S C T W H C Z P
K M N Q E H D N
E K S X A U I D
F F D S V J P J
I I S I T I V Z
R Z L W Y J D E

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
