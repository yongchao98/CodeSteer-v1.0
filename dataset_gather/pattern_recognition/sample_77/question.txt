Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

M U Z H H H H N T
A H O H H H H M N
R A J H H H H Q G
K J X H H H H V L
V Y L Q E K D P Y
O J P E X I P V R
T H V B Z V P A A
X D C H S D H S C
P R Q Y Q O Y N C
X A O M R K D X I
C A H X G L S L F
Q O R U P N B I X
D R Y S W Q W W E
Q V Y Y A Q V H O
N I V N V X O Q D

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
