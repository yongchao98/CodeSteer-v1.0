Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

C M O G B C W G L P
E P C S M W V D K J
L O L V Y U J B V H
Z Q K T I A Y E G R
H H Q O S W J N C M
Q V I T C G Y S X O
P B B W D E W M B S
A L R M P C C M A Y
P C Z B E B S G I X
B F Y O F F F F C D
V K E G F F F F Y C
G D R P F F F F Z N
V M F M F F F F T W
R B P K B Y M N L Y
Y J Z Z Q P X R P Z

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
