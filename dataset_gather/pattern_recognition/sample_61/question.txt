Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

Z W P T I V J I Y
C C J T M B I F Y
Q A F F F F F M Q
J L C F F F F J B
U V M F F F F D N
M G I F F F F S Q
G E T C N M S G U
R S U X D D O P A
H B I R S K B K Z
U N W Z I M J Z Q
K I D J H M C Y R

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
