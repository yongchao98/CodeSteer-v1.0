Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

O P R F A L M G
C Y D Z F V G V
Q I J B I V B E
F A F V V V V L
D B Z V V V V P
Y I O V V V V T
K K J V V V V Q
C V O F E Z J C
J F D V C F S A

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
