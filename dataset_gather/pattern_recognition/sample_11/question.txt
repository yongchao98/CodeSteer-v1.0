Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

U D L G V L V
A K L K E N N
L Z O A V A M
M M M Z K W S
M M M J C M Y
M M M C W Q D
M Y Q P I X Z
A F F U D U G
R L N P P U K
P C M C R N E
V E O J B R I
X Y C R N R R
U C F Z Q T A
Z W H X P M P

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
