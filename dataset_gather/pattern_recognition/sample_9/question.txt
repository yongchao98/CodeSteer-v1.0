Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

L D H X Q G D V E S
E H Y T D Y R T N M
K K K K A M E M M K
K K K K E W X D L N
K K K K Z D U D T N
K K K K Y N V J V F
Z C T J M G V D X P
G D A J R U Y H K L
S U N E R A Y X N Y
K Q I O P N R G N V

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
