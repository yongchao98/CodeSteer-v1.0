Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

T E H Q P S P X
Q T T B V Q N U
G T Y N W W D Y
S X L O O G X S
A F Y S Z Z K A
Z N T A D K J M
L S W B R C C C
O M X K P C C C
I Y G P P C C C
H J G T O Z Z X
W Y J Z G H N D
D C K B W H F P
P B X H O W R H
Y I A S T G U V

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
