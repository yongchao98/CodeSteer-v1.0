Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

I I Z Q A R L S E T F F I J Z
S S S S S H P V T L D C C X J
E S S S S Z H Q G H Q I O E A
R S S S S E Y X F M G F K R V
X S S S S A K O M Z B E P T B
A Y R E A W H K Z Y Q E Z W C
N F B E C K H M W A L R X P K
H R L U Q B G I U E Y T M S Z
L E V S U X L H V U R V Q O O
Q I T C T C S V B O B I F B B

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
