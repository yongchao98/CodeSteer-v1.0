Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

T Q P W M D P W
O S C T A O Y B
F M Q Q L I S R
K Y D P B W E A
O I C U X S H I
R H H H C L T I
K H H H G Z E W
X H H H L Z M D
S W O X E V H Y
R S I W J O I Z
W V O X X N W S
L D X Q O T C N

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
