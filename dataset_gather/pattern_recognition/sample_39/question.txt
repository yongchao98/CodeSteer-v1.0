Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

M Z X B F N A V R R D
M O K C Z Q E I R R I
V A C Q E F U C L A H
Z K G O O A N R W Y Q
K Z L V G O C I K F I
G E F E C O Y Z J O V
S F O W I I M J F N J
G V T M M M M M B I X
T T P M M M M M L Q Z
E K Q M M M M M H V M
D I L M M M M M B T G
A B Q M M M M M N W F
I Q R K G T Y P T X K

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
