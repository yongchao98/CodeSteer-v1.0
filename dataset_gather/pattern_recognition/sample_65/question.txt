Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

E Z I I I M Y V F O X U Q Y
B Y I I I Z Y F X G G Z M I
L C I I I J L M S U G E T X
B S T R E U S A O K M B X A
N F T S C A E C W Q V T A H
T D V U H M E H S Q Q R Z O

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
