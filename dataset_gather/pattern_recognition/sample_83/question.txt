Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

T W V B X J K X O X O L Q
I T T I S N S T N P L H H
E W R A K B T F X N V Z X
M Y R R R H Q E C F P N B
R A R R R K I C Q P E E Q
V O R R R O Z O E P H X X
W W S Q W A K P Y B Z R U
F K R W Q E N O W K F Z R
B Z X W V L C X G I H X F

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
