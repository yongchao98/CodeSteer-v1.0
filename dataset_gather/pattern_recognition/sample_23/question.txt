Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

N Q S F Z W T N M S H G
V R B K X F D N X F Q S
Z B N U L I V C V G W B
B H R X J O U Q E O T G
M R S G C P B A G X H M
A R K N G G P A E R Z J
J A K Y A Z I V E R B X
B L H P D V Y X N B G K
Q U B G S Q W M V U R V
B C L L H X K B U H T N
N P N E J N X Z J S L K
T Q J D T W N K Q F E X
K X I C O L S M M M B Y
X J W Q K L G M M M C M
V D T N X L I M M M T A

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
