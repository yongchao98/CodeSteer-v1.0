Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

Q I A Y W B D K K E J F
Q R M U E Q I I K S X K
Y D R E F U I W H V Y I
L Z S E F P A M D M Y U
X P C C C C H Z V O V V
L T C C C C P Y P A Q V
X O C C C C P C S X O B
P N C C C C Z E A X B L
K R U A O Z C I G S L E
D G O Q O S I U P Z E N

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
