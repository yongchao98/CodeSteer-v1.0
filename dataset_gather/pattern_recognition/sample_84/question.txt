Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

S L R S D A J D K K
D Z O T M N O I I L
T J X K F F F F F W
Q Z A A F F F F F Q
L W R U F F F F F S
Y M X M F F F F F N
P E I E F F F F F F
X F K C W J R W N P
S B P M V J S S L L
C S M U Z U U T F W
E R J A S P T Z L S
X C L R Y L B X W I

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
