Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

G Y V W J I N D X X D
U E T X Y D K C T O I
E G Y A D E Y Y Y Y R
Q B N T O O Y Y Y Y I
U K H U Y Q Y Y Y Y K
T L I A T M Y Y Y Y Y
J A W C I Z N U D T G
K L R U K L A Z Y C K
Z S J R T R X V M Z Q
M W W A C Y S V G W T

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
