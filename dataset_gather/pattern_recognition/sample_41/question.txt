Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

T E E E X V M P Z I V L
P E E E F H E M X Q P W
R E E E C O Q S O T D S
N I B O X T D F I V A T
U T X P E Y U Y P F N F
H B Z I M N X Y A G J W

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
