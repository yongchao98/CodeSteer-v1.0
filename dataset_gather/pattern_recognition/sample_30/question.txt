Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

Q Q N P I O
N M P W M K
F A W M W S
C E E E D V
J E E E F Z
W E E E N I
I Y K L X J
P W L G H P
Q U M G D Q
U M W H D U
F U M X A S

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
