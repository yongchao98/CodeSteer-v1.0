Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

L W F E O J
V J W O V E
F Y F W V T
Z Y Z U Q K
Y Y K W F G
J O S A H L
B G E I K S
C S A A A U
Y A A A A N
U Y A A A G

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
