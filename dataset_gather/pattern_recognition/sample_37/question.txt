Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

W Y D J V K C E B H Q T
M B O C M P P A U W P L
S V Y Z U Z U K W R S Q
O Y K D Y C A W V N U R
C U V I W U A B W D V Y
E I L E V F X J L M R F
D K D D D D D N R L X H
N W D D D D D P O W B K
D F D D D D D D D A E W
E Z D D D D D H I I S D
V Q D D D D D M R O K P
K J I E Q L F T S I A D
K E T H L A E C S P G B
H L Z F C M G X Z L O F

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
