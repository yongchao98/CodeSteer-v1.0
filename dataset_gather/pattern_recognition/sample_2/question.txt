Given a character matrix, your task is to identify the positions of all squares with a length of at least 3 and output the row and column numbers of the bottom-right corner of these squares. The squares are composed of the same character, and each side has a length of at least 3.

If the matrix is

K F K T T Y F S G Z Z
X X S P B S N K T P N
Q I F O K Y W H L A E
S X G S T G U X X C M
O P R K V A Z T K M U
I B X S C D U U U U N
B G K R D Q U U U U R
H T X A Y D U U U U I
W K U O T J U U U U X
A Z F H W H H Y I M M
F X R Z A U T R O O E
K J Z V O N X V Y B C

Please provide the row and column of the bottom-right vertex of the square in the character matrix with a side length of at least 3 (the answer is unique). Notice: All coordinates start from 0.  

Your answer should be in the format <<<[row, column]>>>.
