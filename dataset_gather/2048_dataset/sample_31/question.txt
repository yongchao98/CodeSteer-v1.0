In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.
u: represents moving up one step
d: represents moving down one step
l: represents moving left one step
r: represents moving right one step

Now, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'rdl':
0, 4, 0
8, 0, 2
8, 2, 0

What is the matrix after moving?
