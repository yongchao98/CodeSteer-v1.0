Both parties, A and B, play a game similar to Jungle Chess. Each player has 8 animal pieces, ranked from largest to smallest: Elephant (A), Lion (B), Tiger (C), Leopard (D), Wolf (E), Dog (F), Cat (G), and Mouse (H). Both players reveal their pieces simultaneously, but cannot see the opponent's piece. The referee announces the result of the match.

Rules:
1. The goal for both players is to reach the opponent's den in 5 steps. The first to accumulate 5 steps wins.
2. When a smaller piece encounters a larger piece, the smaller piece is captured, and the player with the larger piece wins.
3. Mutual capture: When pieces of the same type encounter each other, they mutually capture and the result is a draw.
4. Mouse captures Elephant: Apart from the size hierarchy, the Mouse can capture the Elephant, but the Elephant cannot capture the Mouse.
5. Each piece can only be used once.

Assuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.

Rounds:
Round 1: D, loss.
Round 2: A, win.
Round 3: C, loss.
