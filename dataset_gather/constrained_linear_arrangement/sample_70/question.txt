Both parties, A and B, each have a set of five-element flags, with each person holding five cards representing Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each card can only be used once. Both players play their cards simultaneously without seeing the opponent's card, and the referee announces the result of each round.
Rules:
1. When card 1 generates card 2, the holder of card 1 loses;
2. When card 1 overcomes card 2, the holder of card 1 wins;
3. When both cards are the same or no card generates or overcomes each other, it is a draw.
Known:
1. Generation: Wood A generates Fire B, Fire B generates Earth C, Earth C generates Metal D, Metal D generates Water E, Water E generates Wood A.
2. Overcoming: Wood A overcomes Earth C, Earth C overcomes Water E, Water E overcomes Fire B, Fire B overcomes Metal D, Metal D overcomes Wood A.

Assuming you are one of the players, deduce what cards your opponent played each round based on the cards you played and the results of each round.

Rounds:
Round 1: D, draw.
Round 2: A, draw.
Round 3: C, draw.
Round 4: B, win.
Round 5: E, draw.
